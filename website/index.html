		<div id="subtitle">THE UNCERTAIN FATE OF THE SECOND WARD DOMINICK'S</div>
		<div class="widetext">For Evanston, Illinois resident Daphne Watson, feeding a family of six means always looking for a good bargain. She credits Dominick's grocery coupons, and its store employees who informed her when her favorite items were on sale, for helping her get the most out of her budget.</div> 
		<div class="widetext">"Dominick's used to be where I stopped every other day, Watson says. "It was easy to see what everything cost and where things were laid out in the store."</div>
		<div class="twothirds">
			<div class="thirdtextleft">When she heard the whole company was shutting down for good last December, Watson says the news didn't totally sink in until she arrived at the store's parking lot one day - and found it completely empty.</div>
			<div class="thirdtextleft"> "I don't even want to drive down that way anymore. It makes me want to cry," she says.</div>
			<div class="thirdtextleft"> 5 months after the entire Dominick's grocery store franchise was shut down, a 58,000 square foot building and its parking lot remain vacant in the 2nd Ward of Evanston. What was once a Dominick's, and the only major grocery store in the neighborhood, is now unused land with an uncertain future. As residents rearrange their lives to find other places to shop, the city of Evanston has yet to solidify plans with potential owners, or provide specific answers.

		<div class="widetext">This past October, Safeway Inc., the second largest grocery store company in the country, announced that it would be  <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/86144/000008614414000009/swy-122813x10k.htm">terminating its Illinois-based company, Dominick's</a>. By the end of January 2014, all of its 72 stores were closed in Chicagoland and about 5,600 employees were laid off (though some employees were then rehired by the companies that bought former Dominick's stores). While many former Dominick's locations have been <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/suburbs/chi-dominicks-closing-20131205,0,4687692.htmlstory">bought by other grocery franchises</a>, the fate of over half of its former stores remains uncertain. In Chicago, most of the closed stores have been purchased by Mariano's or Jewel, former competitors of Dominick's. But, the majority of stores that have yet to find new owners are located in the suburbs, such as this Evanston 2nd Ward Dominick's.</div>
		<div class="widetext">Vacant buildings are not uncommon to find in the 2nd Ward, but the closing of Dominick's has complicated the lives of many residents. While city leaders note that <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/news/assets/2014%201st%20Quarter%20Report.pdf">new business have come into the neighborhood in recent years</a>, such as Emerson Grill and Fitness Avenues, when driving through the neighborhood, one is still likely to notice boarded up windows and "for rent" signs. None of the new businesses in the 2nd Ward function as grocery stores. </div>

			<div class="thirdtextright">Michael Binford, Associate Professor of History and Urban Affairs at Northwestern University, notes how some residents of the 2nd Ward, especially those of lower income, are now facing additional complications when it comes to food shopping.</div>
			<div class="thirdtextright">"A common assumption in the US is that everyone has a car, but that is quite untrue," says Binford. "And, if you don't have a car, you have to make more frequent trips, you may only be able to visit one store at a time, there is only so much you can carry with you in your hands, etc. Public transportation fares add to your cost of living."</div>
		</div>
		<div class="widespacer"></div>
		<div class="widetext">Binford is also an Evanston resident and used to occasionally shop at the 2nd Ward Dominick's.</div>
		<div class="widetext">Dickelle Fonda, a 2nd Ward resident for 34 years, notes how many of her fellow 2nd ward residents relied on walking to Dominick's, or just a short public transportation ride there, to get their groceries. </div>
		<div class="widetext">"I worry about the residents that are having a hard time getting to other grocery stores, because they don't own a car," she says.
		</div>
		<div class="widetext">On May 8, Fonda was one of about two dozen 2nd Ward residents who attended a regularly scheduled meeting for the neighborhood at the Joseph E. Hill Educational Center. On the agenda for the meeting: updates from the alderman, Peter Braithwaite, the police department, the city manager, and other important local figures. </div>
		<div class="widetext">Missing from the agenda: designated time to discuss the closing of Dominick's. However, as soon as the city employees started taking questions from the floor, the whole first series of questions from residents revolved around the closed grocery store, and when they could expect to see a new one fill the space. </div>
		<div class="widetext">"We are close to being able to talk about the location's future publicly," says Braithwaite. "Three different potential owners approached Safeway. Someone wants to be in there."</div>
		<div class="twothirds">
			<div class="thirdtextleft">Braithwaite added that one potential owner in particular has been talking at length with Safeway about a deal, but he declined to comment further.</div>
			<div class="thirdtextleft">"Until we have something fully baked, we are waiting to release details," he says.</div>
			<div class="thirdtextleft">Johanna Nyden, the Economic Development Division Manager for the city of Evanston, also spoke at the meeting. In an email to us, Nyden explained the role of her division is to "position ourselves to be as helpful as possible to the property owner or potential new tenant so large vacancies can be filled in a timely manner." </div>
			<div class="thirdtextleft">Nyden added that the city "is not engaged in trying to find a potential buyer for the space". That responsibility is technically Safeway's, and the company is still paying taxes on the property. Dominick's moved into it's 2nd Ward location, at 1910 Dempster Street, in the Evanston Plaza. It had served grocery needs for the community for nearly 15 years. </div>

		<div class="widespacer"></div>
		<div class="widetext">Watson thinks that Safeway failed to talk to the community and doesn't truly realize the implications for residents of keeping these locations vacant. </div>
		<div class="widetext">"Just about everyone I knew shopped at the Dominick's. It was conveniently located, and there has been no real routine for us since it closed," she says. </div>
		<div class="widetext">At the May 8th meeting, Nyden, too, acknowledged that details from Safeway have been limited for the 2nd Ward location, and she does not feel "too sympathetic for Safeway. They left us."</div>
		<div class="widetext">As a response to the Dominick's closings, Evanston's mayor, Elizabeth Tisdahl, formed a <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/government/boards-committees/grocery-store-working-group/index.php">Grocery Store Working Group </a>to address the vacancies and provide information. Members include Nyden and Braithwaite. However, the website has not been updated since January.</div>
		<div class="widetext">Earlier this year, Whole Foods purchased another former Dominick's in Evanston, on Green Bay Road, in the 7th Ward. Nyden says this now makes Evanston the only municipality in the country that has 3 different Whole Foods stores.</div>
		<div class="map"><iframe width='100%' height='500px' frameBorder='0' src='http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/dmrogers9.i9hja8ch/attribution,zoompan,geocoder,share.html'></iframe></div>
		<div class="widetext">If you look at where the grocery stores are located in Evanston, aside from this new Whole Foods, all of the major stores run along Howard Street and Chicago Avenue, the city's south and east sides, respectively. It's on these streets that you will find Trader Joe's, Jewel Osco, and the other two Whole Foods. </div>
		<div class="widetext">However, Watson does also hold city officials accountable for the space remaining vacant, and the lack of a large grocery store in west Evanston. </div>
		<div class="widetext">"We live in an economically depressed area of Evanston, and I don't think they care where they get out food from," says Watson, when referring to Evanston city officials. "They tell us, 'Oh you have a grocery store, you have Food 4 Less.' But, how many bananas are at Food 4 Less at any given time? Maybe 5? There are not enough items you can buy there to support a family". Watson adds that she especially misses the Dominick's salad bar.</div>
		<div class="widetext">(Hopefully Grover interview will go here)</div>
		<div class="widetext">However,</div>


<!-- weird stuff in the final draft, so this is to make it so I can see 


		<div class="widetext">"Other owners that are interested in opening up different businesses in the plaza are waiting for a decision to be made on the anchor (**the large, empty Dominick's building) before they decide to move into the Plaza"</div>

-->

 		<div class="widetext">For Watson, Dominick's was more than a grocery store. It employed her husband's aunt, which guaranteed that her family would see their relative several times a week.</div>
 		<div class="widetext">"Dominick's was literally a family for us, just because they were friendly," Watson says.</div>
