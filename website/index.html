		<div id="subtitlespacer"></div>
		<div class="widetext"><p>Feeding a family of six means always looking for a good bargain, for Evanston, Illinois resident Daphne Watson. She credits Dominick's grocery coupons, and its store employees who informed her when her favorite items were on sale, for helping her get the most out of her budget.</p>
		<p>"Dominick's used to be where I stopped every other day, Watson says. "It was easy to see what everything cost and where things were laid out in the store."</p></div>
		<div class="widetext">
		</div>
		<div class="twothirds">
			<div class="thirdtextleft">
				<p>When she heard the whole company was shutting down for good last December, Watson says the news didn't totally sink in until she arrived at the store's parking lot one day - and found it completely empty.</p>
				<p> "I don't even want to drive down that way anymore. It makes me want to cry," she says.</p>
				<p> 5 months after the entire Dominick's grocery store franchise was shut down, a 58,000 square foot building and its parking lot remain vacant in the 2nd Ward of Evanston. What was once a Dominick's, and the only major grocery store in the neighborhood, is now unused land with an uncertain future. As residents rearrange their lives to find other places to shop, the city of Evanston has yet to solidify plans with potential owners, or provide specific answers. </p>

			<p>This past October, Safeway Inc., the second largest grocery store company in the country, announced that it would be  <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/86144/000008614414000009/swy-122813x10k.htm">terminating its Illinois-based company, Dominick's</a>. By the end of January 2014, all of its 72 stores were closed in Chicagoland and about 5,600 employees were laid off (though some employees were then rehired by the companies that bought former Dominick's stores). While many former Dominick's locations have been <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/suburbs/chi-dominicks-closing-20131205,0,4687692.htmlstory">bought by other grocery franchises</a>, the fate of over half of its former stores remains uncertain. In Chicago, most of the closed stores have been purchased by Mariano's or Jewel, former competitors of Dominick's. But, the majority of stores that have yet to find new owners are located in the suburbs, such as this Evanston 2nd Ward Dominick's.</p>

			<p>Vacant buildings are not uncommon to find in the 2nd Ward, but the closing of Dominick's has complicated the lives of many residents. While city leaders note that <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/news/assets/2014%201st%20Quarter%20Report.pdf">new business have come into the neighborhood in recent years</a>, such as Emerson Grill and Fitness Avenues, when driving through the neighborhood, one is still likely to notice boarded up windows and "for rent" signs. None of the new businesses in the 2nd Ward function as grocery stores. </p>

				<p>Tim Higgins has lived in the 2nd Ward of Evanston for the past 8 years, and resides just a block away from the former Dominick's. Since moving into the neighborhood, he has observed some of his neighbors' economic struggles. </p>
				<p>"There are pockets of poverty on my street, where residents seem to barely be getting by," he says. "There are overcrowded homes, with families living in other families' basements."</p>
				<p>Henry Binford, Associate Professor of History and Urban Affairs at Northwestern University, notes how some residents of the 2nd Ward, especially those of lower income, are now facing additional complications when it comes to food shopping.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="widespacer"></div>
		<div class="widetext">
			<p>"A common assumption in the US is that everyone has a car, but that is quite untrue," says Binford. "And, if you don't have a car, you have to make more frequent trips, you may only be able to visit one store at a time, there is only so much you can carry with you in your hands, etc. Public transportation fares add to your cost of living."</p>
			<p>Dickelle Fonda, a 2nd Ward resident for 34 years, notes how many of her fellow 2nd ward residents relied on walking to Dominick's, or just a short public transportation ride there, to get their groceries. </p>
			<p>"I worry about the residents that are having a hard time getting to other grocery stores, because they don't own a car," she says.</p>
			<p>On May 8, Fonda was one of about two dozen 2nd Ward residents who attended a regularly scheduled meeting for the neighborhood at the Joseph E. Hill Educational Center. On the agenda for the meeting: updates from the alderman, Peter Braithwaite, the police department, the city manager, and other important local figures. </p>
			<p>Missing from the agenda: designated time to discuss the closing of Dominick's. However, as soon as the city employees started taking questions from the floor, the whole first series of questions from residents revolved around the closed grocery store, and when they could expect to see a new one fill the space.</p>
			<p>"We are close to being able to talk about the location's future publicly," says Braithwaite. "Three different potential owners approached Safeway. Someone wants to be in there."</p></div>
		<div class="widetext">
				<p>Braithwaite added that one potential owner in particular has been talking at length with Safeway about a deal, but he declined to comment further.</p>
				<p>"Until we have something fully baked, we are waiting to release details," he says.</p>
				<p>Johanna Nyden, the Economic Development Division Manager for the city of Evanston, also spoke at the meeting. In an email to us, Nyden explained the role of her division is to "position ourselves to be as helpful as possible to the property owner or potential new tenant so large vacancies can be filled in a timely manner." </p>
				<p>Nyden added that the city "is not engaged in trying to find a potential buyer for the space". That responsibility is technically Safeway's, and the company is still paying taxes on the property. Dominick's moved into it's 2nd Ward location, at 1910 Dempster Street, in the Evanston Plaza. It had served grocery needs for the community for nearly 15 years. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="widetext">
			<p>At the May 8th meeting, Nyden, too, acknowledged that details from Safeway have been limited for the 2nd Ward location, and that she does not feel "too sympathetic for Safeway. They left us." </p>
			<p>Safeway did not respond to our requests for comment for this story.</p>

			<p>Both city figures and residents repeatedly refer to the former Dominick's as the "anchor" of the Evanston Plaza. Without a grocery store there, "the whole Plaza feels like it is just blowing in the wind," says Higgins. </p>
			<p>Watson thinks that Safeway failed to talk to the community and doesn't truly realize the implications for residents of keeping these locations vacant. </p>
			<p>"Just about everyone I knew shopped at the Dominick's. It was conveniently located, and there has been no real routine for us since it closed," she says. </p>
			<p>For Watson, Dominick's was more than a grocery store. It employed her husband's aunt, which guaranteed that her family would see their relative several times a week. </p>
			<p>"Dominick's was literally a family for us, just because they were friendly. Even though it was a large store, it had a 'Mom and Pop' kind of feel," Watson says. The store also employed several of her children's' friends, some of whom have since been hired by Jewel on Green Bay Road. </p>
			<p>Since the Dominick's closed, Watson feels that she gets the best deals on fresh food by driving up to a "Pick 'N Save" grocery store in Wisconsin. She says Dominick's beat almost everyone else's prices in Evanston. </p>
			<p>"Every six weeks or so, we'll take out the seats in the car to stock up on what we need," she says. The family has an extra freezer in the basement they use to preserve the food, and minimize the trips they need to take to the store. </p>
			<p>Other residents have also had to modify their lives accordingly. </p>
			<p>"Dominick's was the perfect fit for those who lived in West Evanston," says Terry Phillips, a 2nd Ward resident since 1992. Phillips says he now has to drive down to Howard Street to Jewel to find a grocery store that has a big enough parking lot for him to find a space. Other residents, such as Higgins, also talked about overcrowding at the other Evanston grocery stores, in the absence of Dominick's.</p>
			<p>As a response to the Dominick's closings, Evanston's mayor, Elizabeth Tisdahl, formed a <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/government/boards-committees/grocery-store-working-group/index.php" class="none">Grocery Store Working Group </a>to address the vacancies and provide information. Members include Nyden and Braithwaite. However, the website has not been updated since January.</p>
			<p>Earlier this year, Whole Foods purchased another former Dominick's in Evanston, on Green Bay Road, in the 7th Ward. Nyden says this now makes Evanston the only municipality in the country that has 3 different Whole Foods stores.</p>
			<p>This statistic is not sitting well with some residents. </p>
			<p>"Whole Foods isn't the right fit for some of us in Evanston," says Phillips. "I feel its stores are overpriced." </p>
			<p>Higgins says that ideally, a store that comes into the 2nd Ward should reflect the economic and racial diversity of the neighborhood itself. </p>
			<p>"I would like to see a grocery store that reflects demographics of community," says Higgins. "I hope it would be invested in the community, welcome us, and the products and prices would truly reflect those who live here."</p>
			<p>7th Ward Alderperson Jane Grover says she and Nyden have been in meetings with Whole Foods representatives. It was in meetings where she learned that Whole Foods wouldn't be opening this 7th ward location until mid 2015. </p>
			<p>"The Dominick's was a neighborhood anchor," she says. "Residents really want a grocery store to come in sooner rather than later." </p>
			<p>The 7th Ward Dominick's was half a block from her house, and she got to know the store's pharmacists, cashiers, and other employees well. </p>
			<p>"Being a mother of three, I used to spend a lot of time at Dominick's," she says. "Because we lived so close it was easy to just give money to my sons and ask them to run over and pick up groceries for us." </p>
			<p>Grover also helped to plan a farewell party for Dominick's employees in Evanston. Residents created <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.199559763566405.1073741829.195460667309648&type=1">this Facebook page</a> to post photos from the goodbye party, as well as updates on where the former employees have found new work. (Photos on the Facebook page are courtesy of LT Photo Evanston). </p>
			<p>"There were homemade baked goods and signs to thank all of the employees for their years of work, at both the 2nd Ward and 7th Ward closed Dominick's locations," Grover says. "Alderman Braithwaite, Johanna Nyden and I also wrote a blank letter of recommendation to give to every one of the employees for being an essential part of our community, so they have something from us they could use in job search."</p>
			<p>Fonda also assisted with throwing the Dominick's farewell party in the 2nd Ward, and says she often thinks about what will happen to the store's former employees.</p> 
			<p>"I feel so sorry for the people who used to work there," says Fonda. "There were employees who had been there for so many years."</p> 
			<p>While the store was not in her neighborhood, Grover used to shop at the 2nd Ward Dominick's when her son was at classes at Dance Center Evanston. </p>
			<p>"It is essential to the walkability and quality of life for the neighborhood to have a grocery store there," she says. </p>

			<p>If you look at where the grocery stores are located in Evanston, aside from this new Whole Foods, all of the major stores run along Howard Street and Chicago Avenue, the city's south and east sides, respectively. It's on these streets that you will find Trader Joe's, Jewel Osco, and the other two Whole Foods. </p>

			<p>While West Evanston technically does not meet the Food and Drug Administration's specific <a href="http://apps.ams.usda.gov/fooddeserts/foodDeserts.aspx">criteria for a food desert,</a> the issue of food insecurity has become a reality for many residents. The FDA <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/fsec/files/fsguide.pdf">defines food insecurity as</a> "limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways." </p>
			<p>Also in response to the Dominick's closings, the city <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/news/2014/01/2014-brings-new-opportunities-for-closed-dominicks-locations/">published a list of stores in Evanston that are open and sell grocery items.</a> "Evanston still has a number of stores and pharmacies for residents to fulfill their grocery needs", the page says. But, the list includes places like CVS and Walgreens, which is controversial, according to Binford.</p>
			<p>"Sometimes people who argue against food deserts look at the convenience stores that may be available in a neighborhood," says Binford. "But, they don't always have the healthiest options available for shoppers. There has been a push for these stores to include healthier foods, but this isn't always possible, especially because they would have to raise the prices on their goods. Additionally, the primary mission of Walgreens is not to be a grocery store."</P>
			<p>Watson thinks city officials should be held accountable for the space remaining vacant, and the lack of a large grocery store in west Evanston. </p>
			<p>"We live in an economically depressed area of Evanston, and I don't think they care where they get out food from," says Watson, when referring to Evanston political figures. "They tell us, 'Oh you have a grocery store, you have Food 4 Less.' But, how many bananas are at Food 4 Less at any given time? Maybe 5? There are not enough items you can buy there to support a family".</p>
			<p>There are also nutritional consequences that come with not having convenient access to fresh foods. Watson feels that her overall health has declined since the Dominick's closed, both from the stress of finding new places to shop, and being forced to order takeout more often, if she doesn't have the time to drive to a store that is further away from her house. </p>
			<p>"I've put on weight, I don't feel well," she says. "This has also been very tough on an emotional level."</p>
		<!--  I think a wide picture here would be good, this is a placeholder for later -->
			<p>Meanwhile, nonprofits are doing what they can to help combat the food security problems. In Cook County, the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or GCFD, is distributing food to those who are having challenges putting meals on the table. GCFD operates a network of 650 food pantries, shelters, kitchens, and programs for people in need.</p>
			<p>"Evanston tends to be looked upon as an affluent suburb, yet the food insecurity rate is still at 14 percent. That means nearly 1 in 7 people in Evanston don't know where their next meal will come from," says GCFD representative Paul Morello. "With that in mind, the Food Depository has five different programs in Evanston, with many more in the surrounding area."</p>
			<p>GCFD representatives also emphasize that access to fresh food is very important for combating food insecurity and hunger.</p>
			<p>"In a lot of low-income communities in Chicago, there's a local population that struggles to afford fresh food, even if it is available," says Jim Conwell, Director of Communications at the GCFD. "We partner with grocery stores to receive donations. Over 10.2 million pounds of donated food was circulated throughout the county last year. It's nearly doubled in the past 5-6 years."</p>
			<p>These partnerships also give GCFD a unique look into the landscape of the problem of food security. GCFD has had to work to remedy the damage caused by grocery stores leaving neighborhoods.  </p>
			<p>"Different stores have come and gone over the years, and certainly it's not a good thing," says Conwell. "The closings you mostly see are locally-based chains with a rich history in Chicago."</p>
			<p>Another way lack of food harms communities is that residents are unable to learn about healthy eating habits, since they have no access to healthy foods in the first place. While the GCFD doesn't have an in-house nutritionist, they do partner with the Chicago branch of AmeriCorps for nutrition education and demonstrations along with fresh food distribution through their "Producemobile".</p>
			<p>"Nutritionists can come in and give a presentation on how to prepare some healthy dishes and fresh produce will be distributed at the program," says Conwell. "We look to target areas where those nutritious food items are needed most."</p>
			<p>Watson, who maintains a garden to help supplement her own diet, adds that she especially misses the salad bar at Dominick's.</p>
			<p>"I used to make homemade pizza every Friday, with vegetables that I would pick up at that salad bar," she says. Watson says it is more difficult now to shop for healthy snacks and sports drinks for her daughter, Gabby, who is on the track & field team at Evanston Township High School.</p>

			<p>Binford says that while there is demand for a new grocery store in the 2nd Ward, there is also a risk associated with it for potential business owners.  Some residents have a limited grocery budget, he adds, and the store may have to price-down accordingly. </p>
			<p>"A lot of people in the area need to shop for food to eat, and it's not unreasonable to think that someone will eventually occupy the space," he says. "At the same time, it may be challenging to make the economic situation of the area work for your business." </p>
			<p>Binford says that owners of a small grocery store chain may be likely buyers, for if the business venture fails, at least the owners have other stores as a source of profit. </p>
			<p>Braithwaite acknowledges some of the obstacles that come with bringing in news businesses. </p>
			<p>"We are looking at a lot of moving targets with the marketplace," he says. "We have to be mindful of the impact each new building has when it comes into the neighborhood. There's change that's coming to Evanston all the time."</p>
			<p>Grover says that in Evanston, the city tries to actively involve and engage the community in these processes. <a href="http://www.engageevanston.org/ideas/104371/we-lost-the-only-complete-grocery-dominicks">A forum on "Engage Evanston"</a> was set up for residents to post their concerns and input about what they think should come in to replace Dominick's.</p>
			<p> However, "Some decisions have happened without public input," Grover adds. "There is an expectation that the city will have a larger role in this, but in the beginning and the end, these are real estate deals between Safeway and the potential buyers."</p>
			<p>However, Braithwaite also remains optimistic about the possibilities for the location. "West Evanston has highest potential. Someone with a smart plan can come in and establish a successful business," he said at the May 8 meeting. "The future is bright. We are seeing lots of activity and signs that the economy is moving forward."</p>
			<p>Nyden is hopeful that once the empty Dominick's space has a new owner, other owners will also decide to establish businesses in the Plaza. </p>
			<p>"We are all very confident that we will have a grocery store," she says. "For the sanity of Evanston, we need a grocery store there."</p>
